# Neural-FCA

This repository is the implementation of a big homework on the course "Ordered Sets in Data Analysis", taught at HSE University in the first semester of the master's program "Data Science" in the fall and winter of 2022.

Course repository on GitHub: [link](https://github.com/EgorDudyrev/OSDA_course).

The topic of my big homework is **neural Formal Concept Analysis (neural FCA)**. Neural FCA repository on GitHub: [link](https://github.com/EgorDudyrev/OSDA_course/tree/Autumn_2022/neural_fca).

## Repository structure

This repository consists of the following main files:
